# Screen Share Example
This example project shows how you can share local screen while making a Direct Call using `getDisplayMedia`. Local user's camera stream will be replaced with the local screen, and the remote user will be able to see your screen.
 
For more information about screen sharing, please take a look at [our documentation](https://sendbird.com/docs/calls/v1/javascript/guides/direct-call#2-screen-share).
