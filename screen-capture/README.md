# Screen Capture Example
This example shows how you can capture local or remote user's video view during calls. The captured photo is returned as a `base64 string`  which can be transferred or processed easily. 

For more information about screen capture, please take a look at [our documentation](https://sendbird.com/docs/calls/v1/javascript/guides/direct-call#2-capture-video-views).
